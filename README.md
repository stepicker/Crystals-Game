# Crystals Game

This is the fourth assignment for my Coding Bootcamp at Penn University.

After two intense weeks of Javascript, we got to practice jQuery for DOM manipulation.

## How the game works

- You will be given a random "target number" at the start of each game.

- By clicking a crystal, you will add a specific number to your total score. The value of each crystal is hidden until you click on it

- You win the game when your score matches the target number. If you go over, you lose

- The value of each crystal is hidden until you click on it. If you do the math you will knw the value of that crystal for that game

- Each time you win or lose, new random numbers will be generated for the target number and the values of the crystals
