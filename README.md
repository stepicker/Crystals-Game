# Crystals Game

This is the fourth assignment for my Coding Bootcamp at Penn University.

After two intense weeks of Javascript, we got to practice jQuery for DOM manipulation.


## How the game works

- You are given a random "target number" at the start of each game.

- By clicking a crystal, you add a specific number to your score.

- You win the game when your score matches the target number. If you go over, you lose.

- Each time you win or lose, new random values are generated for the target number and the crystals.
